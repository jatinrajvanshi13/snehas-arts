## The Vision

A husband's dream to showcase his wife's talent to the world. She is, in his words, "one of the best artists in whole of Vancouver" but has been too humble to promote her art. This session documents the creation of **Sneha's Arts** - an online art store built with love.

## Closing Thoughts

This store was built in a single session, driven by a husband's love for his wife's art and his desire to share it with the world. Every color choice, every animation, every word was crafted to honor both her Indian heritage and their life together in Vancouver.

The store stands ready. The art awaits its audience.

*"If I ever succeed making my wife become famous... I would love to show the world how it started with this session."*
